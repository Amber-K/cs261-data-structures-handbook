# Binary Search Tree (BST)

A BST is usually implemented as a node with four pointers. One pointer points to a point in memory for a variable to be stored at, one points to the node's parent (the node above it in the tree) if it has one, and other two pointers point to the left and right children of the node (nodes below the current one in the tree) if it has them. BSTs have their nodes organized so that nodes storing smaller variables go on the left and nodes storing larger variables go on the right.

# In Memory

In memory, a BST looks like this:

# Operations

A BST supports the following operations:

* name: description, Big O efficiency, and explain why / what that means
* name: description, Big O efficiency, and explain why / what that means

# Use Cases

A BST is useful \[when\] \[why\].

It is not as good as \[what\] \[why\].

# Example

```
sample code showing creation, and exercising all of the operations
or
a program that doesn't use the structure, and then a version that does
```
