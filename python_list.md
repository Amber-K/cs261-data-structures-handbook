# Python List

A python list is a row of pieces of memory that all have their memory addresses in order. A python list stores a pointer of its first memory address that does not have a variable located at it. When a python list's slots in memory are all in use and it needs room for more variables, it automatically makes a copy of itself twice as large in memory (with all its data stored in the first half of its new slots in memory), then deletes its original self.

# In Memory

In memory, a python list looks like this:

# Operations

A \[widget\] supports the following operations:

* name: description, Big O efficiency, and explain why / what that means
* name: description, Big O efficiency, and explain why / what that means

# Use Cases

A python list is useful \[when\] \[why\].

It is not as good as \[what\] \[why\].

# Example

```
sample code showing creation, and exercising all of the operations
or
a program that doesn't use the structure, and then a version that does
