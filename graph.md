# Graph

A graph is a dynamic array of vertex names, each grouped with a stored variable and a corresponding dynamic array of edges. Vertices are named points on graphs with stored variables. Vertices can be connected to any other vertices in the same graph by edges.

# In Memory

In memory, a graph looks like this:

\[description of diagram\]

# Operations

A \[widget\] supports the following operations:

* Add Vertex: description, Big O efficiency, and explain why / what that means
* Add Edge: description, Big O efficiency, and explain why / what that means

# Use Cases

A graph is useful \[when\] \[why\].

It is not as good as \[what\] \[why\].

# Example

```
sample code showing creation, and exercising all of the operations
or
a program that doesn't use the structure, and then a version that does
```
