# Linked List

A linked list is implemented as a node with two pointers, one that points to a variable in memory and another that points to the following linked list node. Whole linked lists can be made up of any number of nodes. The first node will have nothing pointing to it, while each other node will have one node pointing to it. The end node will not point to anything.

# In Memory

In memory, a linked list looks like this:

# Operations

A linked list supports the following operations:

* name: description, Big O efficiency, and explain why / what that means
* name: description, Big O efficiency, and explain why / what that means

# Use Cases

A linked list is useful \[when\] \[why\].

It is not as good as \[what\] \[why\].

# Example

```
sample code showing creation, and exercising all of the operations
or
a program that doesn't use the structure, and then a version that does
```
