# Deque

A deque is a dynamic row of pieces of memory that all have their memory addresses in order. In a deque, variables can be put in on both ends and tracked by pointers. The variables on the very ends can then be removed.

# In Memory

In memory, a deque looks like this:

# Operations

A deque supports the following operations:

* Enqueue Front: description, Big O efficiency, and explain why / what that means
* Dequeue Front: description, Big O efficiency, and explain why / what that means

# Use Cases

A deque is useful \[when\] \[why\].

It is not as good as \[what\] \[why\].

# Example

```
sample code showing creation, and exercising all of the operations
or
a program that doesn't use the structure, and then a version that does
```
