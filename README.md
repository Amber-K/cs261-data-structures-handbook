# Data Structures Handbook

by Amber Kolar

Data structures are ways of organizing data in memory. I have mastered the data structures listed below, which are useful for a variety of applications. Having mastered these data structures proves that I am capable of creating programs that handle data efficiently. Not knowing data structures would inevitably lead to the creation of programs that put data through unnecessarily complicated operations. Because these data structures are the tools needed to handle data practically, it is good to know about my knowledge of them.

## The List

* [Array](array.md)
* [Python List](python_list.md) 
* [Set](set.md)
* [Tuple](tuple.md)
* [Dictionary/Hash Table](dictionary.md)
* [Stack](stack.md)
* [Queue](queue.md)
* [Deque](deque.md)
* [Linked List](linked_list.md)
* [Tree](tree.md)
* [Binary Search Tree](bst.md)
* [Priority Queue](priority_queue.md)
* [Graph](graph.md)
