# Tree

A tree is implemented as a node with usually at least three pointers. One pointer points to a point in memory for a variable to be stored at, one points to the node's parent (the node above it in the tree) if it has one, and other pointers point to children of the node (nodes below the current one in the tree) if it has any.

# In Memory

In memory, a tree looks like this:

# Operations

A tree supports the following operations:

* name: description, Big O efficiency, and explain why / what that means
* name: description, Big O efficiency, and explain why / what that means

# Use Cases

A tree is useful \[when\] \[why\].

It is not as good as \[what\] \[why\].

# Example

```
sample code showing creation, and exercising all of the operations
or
a program that doesn't use the structure, and then a version that does
```
