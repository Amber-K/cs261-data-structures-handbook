A tuple is a fixed row of pieces of memory that all have their memory addresses in order. Tuples are immutable, which means that once one is initialized, its contents will not be able to be changed.

# Operations

A tuple supports the following operations:

* name: description, Big O efficiency, and explain why / what that means
