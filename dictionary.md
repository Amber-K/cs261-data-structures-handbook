# Dictionary/Hash Table

Dictionaries and hash tables are collections of points in memory that can be given variables and found using keys. Every variable stored in a dictionary or hash table must have a key stored with it. When passed a key, a dictionary or hash table will put the key through a hash function to turn it into a number associated with a memory address, the memory address where the associated variable will be stored.

# In Memory
